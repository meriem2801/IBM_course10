# SpaceX Launch Success Prediction  
**IBM Data Science Professional Certificate – Capstone Project**

This project is an end-to-end **data science case study** analyzing **SpaceX Falcon 9 launches** and predicting **first-stage landing success** using real-world data.

It demonstrates my ability to go from **data collection** to **machine learning**, including analysis, visualization, and deployment.

---

## What I Did

- Collected launch data via **SpaceX API** and **web scraping**
- Cleaned and prepared datasets for analysis
- Performed **EDA using Python & SQL**
- Built **interactive dashboards** with Dash & Plotly
- Trained and evaluated **machine learning classification models**
- Interpreted results to support business decisions
